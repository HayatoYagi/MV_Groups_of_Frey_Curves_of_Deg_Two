    We study the family of elliptic curves $y^2 = x (x - a^2)(x+b^2)$, where $(a,b,c)$ are Pythagorean triples.
    This is the family of the Frey curves of degree $2$.
    We can $1$-parameterize Pythagorean triples by rational numbers and consider the family as an elliptic curve over a function field.
    \begin{equation}
        E_{1,s}: y^{2} = x(x - 4s^{2})(x + (s^{2} - 1)^{2})
    \end{equation}

    It is known that the generic rank of the Mordell-Weil group of $E_{1,s}$ over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}(s)$ is $0$.
    We found an infinite subfamily of $E_{1,s}$ whose Mordell-Weil group has positive rank over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}(s)$, which means that there are infinitely many Pythagorean triples $(a,b,c)$ such that the Frey curve $y^2 = x (x - a^2)(x+b^2)$ has positive rank.
    \textcolor{red}{TODO: $\mathbb{Q}(s)$上でランク正の無限族じゃないと，Frey curve が無限個とは言い難い}
    Each elliptic curve over a function field corresponds to an elliptic surface.
    We prove that the Mordell-Weil group of the subfamily has exactly rank $1$ over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}(s)$ using the theory of elliptic surfaces.
